Smurfs Village isn't taking as much time anymore
Testing this game to see if it still works
Authentication issue, annoying, but not game breaking
Daily game status
Childhood memories
!-->

I started playing this game (Motor World: Car Factory) again tonight, as I wanted to test to see if it still worked. It was a game from my early childhood. Surprisingly, it is still functional. The only annoying part is that it constantly tells me that the game is "not authenticated" which is pretty annoying, but it still lets me play, and hasn't reset my progress yet. It is a Mobage game, and Mobage shut down most of their games in 2015, so this game hasn't been updated in years.

I decided to make this game a 2nd daily game, as the other game (Smurfs Village) doesn't have as much to do, and I want to document this game, as part of my life archive project. It is a good game. - August 5th 2021

### Cars

I produced 3 cars, but ran out of money. I don't care how expensive they are, I can wait multiple days for them to sell. I can be the Apple Inc. of cars here (low quality, high price) the game is interesting. - August 5th 2021

### Level progress

I leveled up from level 1 to level 5 today. - August 5th 2021

### Worker level

I got a few of my workers to level 2 and 3, to make the game more efficient. - August 5th 2021

### Short on coins

I am short on coins, I just started the game, and I haven't sold more than 1 car yet. I am slowly working on fixing this, there should be more progress on this tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

### Advertising

There are no ads in this game or the ad servers are down for good. - As of August 5th 2021 to August 5th 2021

### Enjoyment

My enjoyment for this game was moderate today. It will get more exciting when there is less tutorial, and more coins. - August 5th 2021
